## About The Project

StreamLabs is a movie/series streaming application that uses web scraping techniques to extract the required info and metadata from the net. These data are later fed to the VLC media player and start streaming using some required plugins available in the VLC player. This project is implemented using python language using web scraping packages and many more. 


* Usually, we use to pay for streaming services or need to download the whole file in order to watch the movie/series:dizzy_face:
* Instead, this application helps us to stream the movie directly without any need to download the file. In case needed, can download the movie/series using the same application later, as the download option is provided :sunglasses:
